# Contractor Packet (One Page)

## Read first
- README.md
- docs/SOP_MULTICHAT.md
- boot/ (bootpack rules)

## Hard constraints
- Do not edit upstream/ or boot/_upstream_runtime/
- Do not commit private/local artifacts
- Do not rename modules/paths without an explicit Decision/ADR

## Definition of done
- `bash tools/verify_tree.sh` passes
- change is scoped
- docs updated if a contract changed
