# Security (nukeCE)

This document expands on the repo-level policy in `SECURITY.md`.

## Security philosophy

- Clarity over obscurity.
- Explainable ops and provenance over guesswork.
- Minimize blast radius and keep changes auditable.

## Roles and access expectations

Operator (human):
- Commits, pushes, and merges.
- Owns approvals and access control.
- Runs repo-gates and validation.

AI workers (Codex, Gemini, Copilot):
- Draft-only contributions; no commit/push.
- Provide citations/provenance for external sources.
- No direct access to secrets or privileged credentials.

- `docs/ops/OUTPUT_FORMAT_CONTRACT.md`

## Secrets management

- Do not store secrets in the repo.
- Use environment variables or a local secrets manager for sensitive values.
- Rotate and document remediation if exposure occurs.

## AI usage policy

- AI assistance is allowed with human oversight.
- Human review is required before merge.
- External claims must include sources or provenance.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Preferred:
- GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.

Fallback:
- Contact repo owners via GitHub and request a private channel.

Please include:
- Clear description of the issue.
- Minimal reproduction steps.
- Affected files/versions (if known).
- Suggested mitigation (optional).

## Handling and disclosure

- We acknowledge reports as soon as practical.
- Fixes prioritize impact, exploitability, and clarity.
- We aim for coordinated, responsible disclosure.

## Known issues and future improvements

- Legacy MD5 hashing in legacy code paths should be replaced.
- Legacy upstream snapshots contain outdated patterns pending modernization.
