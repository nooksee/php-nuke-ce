# NukeSecurity Data Feeds

Data Feeds provide controlled updates for external security datasets
(IP ranges, country mappings, threat lists).

Design:
- Deterministic sources (CSV/JSON)
- Manual admin-triggered import
- Full audit logging
- AI-assisted diff summaries (future)

Historical notes on NukeSentinel-era updates live in `docs/_archive/SECURITY_LEGACY_NOTES.md`.
