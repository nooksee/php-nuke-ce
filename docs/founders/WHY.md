# Founder's why

nukeCE exists to make legacy CMS systems **explainable, governable, and safe to modernize**.

Most CMS work fails for the same reason: *teams lose the thread*.
Changes land without provenance, assumptions harden into “facts,” and the system becomes impossible to reason about.

nukeCE is a counter-move:

- **Explainability-first:** the repo should explain itself to a new operator.
- **Provenance-forward:** imported code and decisions are tracked and reviewable.
- **Governance-by-default:** PR-only merges + required gates + minimal “hero pushes”.
- **Modern operations on a legacy base:** stabilize first, then upgrade by surfaces.

If we do this right, a newcomer should open the repo and feel:
“Someone serious runs this place.”
