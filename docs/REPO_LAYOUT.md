# Repo layout (high-level)

This is the “what goes where” map that contractors can understand in 90 seconds.

## Top-level

- `public_html/` — deployable webroot (what the server serves)
- `src/` — nukeCE core source (primary development)
- `packages/` — extracted/imported features adapted into nukeCE
- `upstream/` — read-only donor snapshots (do not edit)
- `docs/` — governance, architecture, ops, and contributor docs
- `boot/` — “Lazarus Pit” materials (resurrection prompts + context pack)
- `tools/` — repo gates and safety scripts

## Key docs

- `README.md` — project front door
- `PROJECT_MAP.md` — where to work / what is what
- `PROJECT_TRUTH.md` — truth-layer rules (what counts as “real”)
- `STATE_OF_PLAY.md` — current state + near-term priorities
- `CANONICAL_TREE.md` — canonical tree / structure expectations
- `docs/ops/INDEX.md` — ops index (“how we operate”)
- `docs/ops/DAILY_COCKPIT.md` — the daily NetBeans-first cockpit plan
