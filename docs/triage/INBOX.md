# Triage Inbox (allowed to be messy)

Purpose: Capture ideas fast without losing them or polluting canon.
Rule: If it’s not linked from an index OR listed here, it’s drift.

## How to use
- Add new ideas here immediately.
- Each entry must have: why it exists + next action + status.
- Promote to canon only when you deliberately “graduate” it:
  - move into the right docs/ area
  - link it from docs/00-INDEX.md and the relevant sub-index
  - log it in STATE_OF_PLAY.md

## Status values
- INBOX (new)
- PROMOTE (ready to become canon)
- PROTOTYPE (try it in code/docs first)
- ARCHIVE (keep but out of the way)
- DELETE (not worth keeping)
