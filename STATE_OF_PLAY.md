- What shipped:
  - Added `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/DAILY_CONSOLE.md`, `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/AI_CONTEXT_SYNC.md`, `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/CONTEXT_PACK.md`, `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/COPILOT_ONBOARDING.md`, `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/GEMINI_ONBOARDING.md`, `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/IDE_MIGRATION.md`.
  - Updated `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/RECOVERY.md` and `ops/init/icl/launch_pack/README.md`.
  - Updated `ops/contracts/OUTPUT_FORMAT_CONTRACT.md`, `ops/contracts/CONTRACTOR_DISPATCH_CONTRACT.md`, and `ops/init/protocols/SAVE_THIS_PROTOCOL.md`.
  - Added `ops/templates/CONTRACTOR_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` and `ops/templates/CONTRACTOR_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.
  - Updated `ops/init/icl/context_pack.json` for the new ops canon pointers.
  - Converted docs/ops duplicates into pointer stubs and refreshed `docs/ops/INDEX.md`.
  - Updated `PROJECT_MAP.md`, `CANONICAL_TREE.md`, and docs indexes/references (`docs/00-INDEX.md`, `docs/10-QUICKSTART.md`, `docs/CONTRACTOR_PACKET.md`, `docs/REPO_LAYOUT.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `docs/20-GOVERNANCE.md`, `docs/README_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/security/README.md`).

  - `bash ops/init/pack.sh --help` ✅
  - `grep -R \"(boot/|/boot|console|DAILY_CONSOLE|launch_pack|launchpack)\" -n .` ✅
- Risk / rollback:
