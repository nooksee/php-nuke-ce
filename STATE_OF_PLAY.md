# State of Play — 2026-01-03

## Completed
- Docs Family v1 integrated + canon spine created (docs/00-INDEX, 10-QUICKSTART, 20-GOVERNANCE, 30-RELEASE_PROCESS, 40-PROJECT_HYGIENE)
- Added Copilot onboarding rules: .github/copilot-instructions.md
- Added SSOT “save-game” handover file: docs/ops/AI_CONTEXT_SYNC.md

- Added ops governance docs: OUTPUT_FORMAT_CONTRACT + Copilot onboarding + Gemini onboarding
- Updated docs/ops/INDEX.md + docs/00-INDEX.md to link the new ops docs
- Standardized PROJECT_MAP.md bullets for docs/ops/, upstream/, and .github/workflows/ to clarify roles

## Active blockers
- repo-gates (FAIL-mode) blocking PR until this STATE_OF_PLAY update is committed + pushed

## Next steps (ordered)
1. Save all edited docs in NetBeans
2. Commit updates on current work branch
3. Push branch and re-run repo-gates via PR checks
4. Merge PR once repo-gates are green ✅

## Notes
- This PR is documentation/governance only; no runtime behavior changes intended.
