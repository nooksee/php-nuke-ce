# D-0001 — AI is assist-only

**Status:** ratified  
**Effective:** 2025-12-25

## Decision
AI may assist with analysis, summarization, proposal generation, and checks, but must never auto-enforce rules or canon. All enforcement and ratification remains human-controlled.

## Rationale
- Preserves human authority and accountability
- Prevents silent drift and “auto-canon”
- Keeps epistemic friction visible (the system can propose, not decide)

## Implications
- AI features must be opt-in, assistive, and auditable
- Any “approve/reject”, “publish”, “ratify”, or “enforce” action is a human action
- The system should surface uncertainty rather than flatten it
