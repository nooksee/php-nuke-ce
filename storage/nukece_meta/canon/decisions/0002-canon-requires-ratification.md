# D-0002 — Canon requires explicit ratification

**Status:** ratified  
**Effective:** 2025-12-25

## Decision
Only explicit **Decision** objects constitute canon. Chat transcripts, summaries, and convenience notes are not canon until ratified.

## Rationale
- Separates “what was said” from “what is binding”
- Avoids accidental doctrine via repetition
- Keeps governance legible and auditable

## Implications
- Any proposed architectural change must be expressed as a Decision candidate
- Canon can be versioned, superseded, and traced

## Evidence (transcript pointers)
