# Clubs module (DaDaClub lineage)

Clubs are miniature communities inside the portal:
- Independent membership per club
- Roles per club: member / moderator / admin
- Public vs private clubs
- Optional approval workflow

Localized tools per club:
- Club News
- Club Downloads (member-only)
- Events
- Club Discussion (mini forum)

Design goal: integrate smoothly without hacking core.
