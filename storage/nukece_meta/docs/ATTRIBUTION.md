# Attribution & Credits

nukeCE is built in the lineage of PHP-Nuke and the community forks/mods that followed.

## Policy
- Preserve upstream headers and license notices.
- Add new headers only for **new files** or **substantial rewrites**.
- Prefer crediting in `CREDITS.md` and module-level README files rather than spamming every file.

## “Pretty, but honest”
Uniform formatting is welcome, but never at the cost of:
- removing author names
- altering license text
- obscuring provenance
