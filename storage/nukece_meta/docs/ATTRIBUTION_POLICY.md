# Attribution Policy

Goals:
- Preserve **upstream licensing and attribution** (letter + spirit).
- Avoid misattribution by guessing.
- Keep nukeCE headers uniform for files we own, without erasing upstream provenance.

Rules:
1. Do **not** remove upstream copyright/license/author headers.
2. If a file is derived from upstream, keep the upstream attribution block and add nukeCE header **above or below** it.
3. If code is removed, ensure any associated attribution/docs are also updated (see `docs/REMOVAL_LEDGER.md`).
4. Verbatim upstream texts are preserved under `docs/upstream/`.
