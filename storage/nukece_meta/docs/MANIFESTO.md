# nukeCE Design Manifesto
**PHP-Nuke CE — Community Edition / Custom Edition**

## Why nukeCE Exists
nukeCE exists because **software should give people a voice**, not take one away.

In the early days of the web, PHP-Nuke represented something radical: a complete, do-it-yourself publishing system that ordinary people could install, modify, understand, and own.

nukeCE exists to finish that conversation — with modern security, modern humility, and respect for lineage.

## What nukeCE Refuses to Become
- Not a museum piece
- Not a fork explosion
- Not a Frankenstein distro
- Not a walled garden
- Not an opaque system

If a feature cannot be explained, audited, disabled, or removed — it does not belong.

## How nukeCE Honors Francisco
Francisco Burzi lowered the barrier to participation. nukeCE honors that intent without repeating the mistakes:

- AI may propose; **humans canonize**
- Explanation over invention
- Visible power, accountable systems

## Freedom
Freedom to run, understand, modify, and own your site.
Freedom from algorithmic capture.
Freedom for community, durability, and knowledge.

nukeCE is not loud.

It is **coherent**.
