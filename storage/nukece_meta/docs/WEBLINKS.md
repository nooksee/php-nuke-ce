# Links (Web Links)

Classic PHP-Nuke Web Links often became a "link graveyard" because it stored URLs without context.

nukeCE keeps the original promise (discoverability + community curation) but adapts it for 2026:
- every link needs *why it matters*
- tags are mandatory in spirit (UI encourages them)
- submissions go to a *pending* queue
- humans approve; AI can assist later (summaries/tags), but never silently publishes

Sister module: Reference
- Links can become sources for Reference entries.
- In future: "AI proposes → humans canonize" can auto-draft Reference proposals from approved Links.
