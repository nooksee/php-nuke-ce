# Boot docs — Start here

These documents exist to keep nukeCE *resurrectable* if a chat dies, a contractor rotates in, or a laptop goes poof.

**If you’re new:**
1. Read `docs/ops/INDEX.md` (repo “front door”).
2. Use `boot/active/boot_pack/RESURRECTION.md` to spin up a new chat or contractor.
3. Follow `docs/ops/DAILY_COCKPIT.md` for the NetBeans-first day plan.

**House rules (non-negotiable)**
- No direct pushes to `main`.
- Work happens on `work/*` branches → PR → required gates green → merge.
- Prefer NetBeans review/diff over terminal bravado.

> Note: Older historical boot notes were moved to `boot/docs/_archive/` to reduce noise.
