# nukeCE Boot Pack v0

This folder is the minimal **session reset package** for nukeCE.

Use in a fresh chat:
1) Upload this `boot_pack_v0/` folder (or zip).
2) Say: **"Load this Boot Pack as the active context. Operate strictly within it. New canon requires explicit Decision objects."**

Non-negotiable rules:
- **Assist-only AI** (analysis/proposals allowed; never auto-enforce)
- **Canon = ratified Decisions only**
- **Provenance first** (link claims to evidence/artifacts)
- **Visible epistemic friction** (surface uncertainty; don't smooth it over)
