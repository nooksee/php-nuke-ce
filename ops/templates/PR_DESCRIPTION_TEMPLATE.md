# PR Description Template (canonical)

Purpose: Ensure every PR is self-documenting, reviewable, and reversible.

Use this template in:
- GitHub PR description (auto-filled via .github/pull_request_template.md)
- Any work handoff to assistants/contractors (copy/paste)

Each section uses a prose line followed by a fenced block for copy/paste.

## Purpose
- One sentence on the goal or problem.

## Verification
