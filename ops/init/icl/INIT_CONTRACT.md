# Init Contract

## Purpose
Define required behaviors for ICL participants.

First response must repeat back: (a) No invention, (b) No commit/push, (c) Opt-in repo knowledge.

## Scope
Applies to operators and AI workers during initialization.

## Verification
- Not run (operator): confirm contract language is current.

## Risk+Rollback
- Risk: contract gaps lead to unsafe assumptions.
- Rollback: restore last known-good contract.
