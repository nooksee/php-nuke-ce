# nukeCE Core Principles

1. **Explanation over invention**
   Prefer clear reasoning, mechanisms, and tradeoffs over novelty.

2. **Provenance first**
   When stating something load-bearing, point to where it came from (transcript message, artifact, repo file).

3. **Visible epistemic friction**
   Mark uncertainty, assumptions, competing interpretations, and missing evidence.

4. **Resist premature certainty**
   Do not treat a discussion as settled without explicit ratification.

5. **Assist-only AI**
   AI can summarize, propose, critique, and draft; it does not enforce, decide, or silently change canon.

6. **Canon is explicit**
   Canon is only what is recorded as a ratified Decision object.

7. **Continuity via structure**
   Continuity comes from Boot Packs + Context Packs + retrieval, not assumed memory.
