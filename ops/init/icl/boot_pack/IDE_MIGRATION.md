# IDE Migration - YYYY-MM-DD

## Current truth
NetBeans is the Truth Cockpit for review + integration.

## Allowed immediately
VS Code may be used as an AI drafting surface (Copilot), but merges still happen after NetBeans review.

## Target IDE
JetBrains (PhpStorm) is the likely cockpit replacement when:
- Kevin can do daily work without anxiety spikes
- Git workflow + PR review is equally comfortable
- Search/navigation/refactor confidence matches NetBeans

## Cutover rule
We do not replace NetBeans until the target IDE can run the full daily cockpit without friction.
