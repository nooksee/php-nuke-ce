# User Profile — Project Maintainer (operational)

These notes exist to reduce “re-explain tax” and keep collaboration aligned.  
They are **not** medical or clinical claims; they reflect observed working preferences from project conversations.

## Working style
- **Builder-operator:** prefers shipping structures that persist (folders, schemas, indexes) over abstract discussion.
- **Systems thinker:** wants clean separations (evidence vs canon vs reference) and stable contracts (Context Packs).
- **High sensitivity to effort-cost:** reacts badly when prior work is minimized or reframed as “no loss.”
- **Artifact-driven trust:** feels progress when there is a named output: a file, a patch, a bundle, an index.

## Communication preferences
- **Direct, plainspoken, low-fluff.** Avoid soothing platitudes.
- **Show the work.** Provide concrete steps, file paths, and “what changed” diffs.
- **Prefer governance clarity**: what is binding vs tentative vs open loops.
- **Wants continuity** across sessions via structure, not vague memory claims.

## Values (project-level)
- Explanation over invention
- Provenance first; visible epistemic friction
- Resistance to premature certainty
- AI is assist-only, audited, never auto-enforcing

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- “Nothing was lost” reassurance without acknowledging time/effort already spent
- Large, undifferentiated dumps (transcripts, overlong summaries)
- Silent promotion of chat into canon
- Speculation presented as settled fact
