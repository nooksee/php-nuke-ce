# Save This Protocol

## Purpose
Define the save/retain procedure for critical artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to outputs required for ICL handoff.
Trigger: At end of any session resulting in a code change OR canon/process decision.

## Verification
- Not run (operator): confirm save targets.

## Risk+Rollback
- Risk: lost artifacts.
- Rollback: regenerate or re-export outputs.
