# Snapshot Protocol

## Purpose
Define when to take a session snapshot and how to capture it.

## Scope
Applies at the end of ICL sessions and before handoff. Guidance for an optional PDF snapshot can be used for offline archival.

## Verification
- Not run (operator): confirm snapshot timing and artifacts.

## Risk+Rollback
- Risk: missing or partial snapshots.
- Rollback: re-run snapshot capture with full context.
