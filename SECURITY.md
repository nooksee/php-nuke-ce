# Security Policy

If you believe you found a security issue: **thank you**. Please report it responsibly so we can fix it without turning the repo into a tutorial for attackers.

## Please do NOT

- Open a public issue with exploit details
- Post proof-of-concept payloads publicly
- “Test in production” (ask first if you’re unsure)

## Preferred reporting method

Use a **GitHub Security Advisory** for this repository.

If that’s not possible, contact the maintainers privately with:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (safe + minimal)
- Affected files/areas
- Suggested fix if you have one

## What happens next

- We’ll acknowledge the report
- We’ll investigate + reproduce
- We’ll patch and ship a fix
- We’ll credit you if you want (optional)

nukeCE aims to be explainable — and that includes security fixes: clear cause, clear patch, clear provenance.
