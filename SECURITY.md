# Security Policy

If you believe you’ve found a security issue: thank you. Seriously. 🙏  
Now please don’t post it publicly yet.

## Preferred reporting method
- Use a **GitHub Security Advisory** for this repository (preferred), or
- Email the maintainer if an advisory isn’t possible

## What to include
- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept (safe and minimal)
- Affected files / versions (if known)
- Suggested fix or mitigation (optional, but appreciated)

## Please do not
- Open a public issue with exploit details
- Post reproduction steps in Discussions or PR comments

## Scope notes
- This project contains legacy surfaces. We prioritize fixes that:
  - reduce exploitability,
  - improve containment,
  - and preserve explainability/provenance.

We’ll respond as soon as practical, and we’ll aim to coordinate disclosure responsibly.
